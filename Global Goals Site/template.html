		<p>The world we live in today is constantly changing with the population constantly increasing. To deal with this and accommodate everyone, modern, sustainable, and greeen cities need to be built. For all of us to survive, prosper, and live comfortabke lives, we need new urban planning that is intelligent and creates safe, affordable, and resilient cities with green and culturally inspiring living conditions. The United Nations aims to tackle this goal by giving 10 smaller targets for countries, cities and commmunities to begin action. These targets include;

		</br>
		</br>
		- Safe and affordable housing
		</br>

		- Affordable and sustainable transport systems
		 </br>

		 - Inclusive and sustainable urbanization
			</br>

		- Protect the worlds cultural and natural heritage
			</br>

		- Reduce the adverse effects of natura disasters
			</br>

		- Reduce the environmental impact of cities
			</br>

		- Provide access to safe and inclusive green and public spaces
			</br>

		- Strong national and regional development planning
			</br>

		- Implement polocies fir inclusion, resource efficeiency, and disaster risk reduction
			</br>

		- Support least developed countries in sustainable and resilient building

	  <h1>Stats & More Information</h1>
</div>

<div class="content2">
	<p>Today around half of humanity (about 4 billion people) lives in urban areas and almost 60% of the world population will inhabit urban areas by 2030; 95% of urban expansion in the coming decades will occur in developing countries; currently 30% of the world's urban population lives in slums or otherwise in conditions of housing discomfort and this rate is constantly increasing. Furthermore, cities occupy only 3% of the earth's surface but they are responsible for 60% - 80% of energy consumption and 75% of carbon emissions. The difficulty of meeting the basic needs of millions has become an ever-increasing problem. This rapid urbanization puts pressure on fresh water supplies, sewers, environment and public health. Overpopulation, excessive consumption, pollution, and depletion of resources have presented environmental and health challenges in major cities as well. So it is a priority to achieve goal 11 for the 2030 UN Agenda.

	<p>Community urban gardens, green districts and sustainable communities that are now spreading like wildfire all over the world. Further examples of what is being done include; producingorganic products, using solar plants for hot water production and electricity, permaculture, green building, phytodepuration for water recycling is applied and where electric vehicles were introduced. Fortunately, for a few decades, civil society and public institutions have also started working on disaster risk management. Bio-engineering works to cope with  hydro-geological instability as an example, having the dual function of mitigating the landslides risk and oxygenating heavily polluted areas. As well as the resettlement of communities located in highly vulnerable areas through the construction of new facilities, designed for the adaptation to climate change and able to withstand tornadoes, earthquakes and floods, while totally respecting the residants' traditions.

		<button class="accordion">What is a sustainable city?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>The general consensus is that it is a city that minimizes the inputs and outputs. This means, they use fewer resources and create less waste. When it comes to sustainablity in the context of sustainable cities, there is an underlying consideration of the environmental impact. These factors include, but are not limited to, water, air pollution, energy, and waste. With over half the world's population living in cities, there is a desire to make cities work better and healthier.</p>
			</div>

		<button class="accordion">What are some things I can do in my life to help?</button>
			<div class="panel">
			  <p>The average person doesn't have to do a lot in this area to make a significant difference, but if everyone does a few things on a daily basis, it will have a massive impact on making your city a better more sustainable place. A few things you can do include taking the public transit, biking, or walking instead of taking a car. You can also eat locally and start a garden. These small things will have an impact on the quality of your city and work towards a greener, healthier future.</p>
